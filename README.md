# 🤖 Appliance Automation Using Hand Gestures

This project enables hands-free control of household appliances using real-time hand gesture recognition. By combining deep learning, sensor data, and embedded systems, it allows users — especially the elderly or physically impaired — to control smart devices through intuitive hand movements.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Enable gesture-based appliance control using a wearable glove
- Build a two-part system: gesture recognition module + appliance control hub
- Use Bluetooth and microcontrollers for wireless communication
- Reduce dependency on traditional switches for accessibility and convenience

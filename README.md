# Application-Automation-Using-Hand-Gestures
To help the specially-abled, elderly and children ease their lifestyle by making interaction with the home appliances easier, as now they can directly communicate using hand gestures.

Our designed system in its first stage i.e. Recognition stage, captures the image. It will process the captured image and compare it with the database images. Each database image will be set to the command interface mode. If a particular image is identified then a command will be sent to the microcontroller. In its second stage the microcontroller will identify the command and send a signal to the reference port for operation.

This project mainly consists of a Hand Gesture Recognition section and a Control hub section. The hand gesture recognition section consists of a microcontroller and a transmitter. The control hub consists of a receiver, a microcontroller, a relay switch and a Bluetooth module.
